Quick Guide

For External Partners
August 2023 v1.0

1Welcome

This document is the beginning of our brand journey as X.

We know many partners use our logos in a variety of places
to help signpost where your audience can ï¬nd you.

We also appreciate the importance of keeping this
information up-to-date and accurate.

With that in mind, this document provides details on how to
use our new branding including logo use, primary colors,
typography, terminology, posts and asset download.

Please note that as we continue to build out X, we will continue
to update and evolve our guidance. This guide isn't exhaustive,
please reach out to your X brand partner if you are looking for
something that isn't speciï¬cally covered here.

2Logo

The X logo is black or white. It must be legible and maintain the
integrity of its form. Our logo should be large and clear in external
communications.

Color Treatment
Logo should be white on black background or black on white
background.

Clearspace
The empty space around the logo should be at minimum equal
width left, right, top, bottom.

Exception: For non-digital or non-monochrome environments, the logo
should be white on darker backgrounds and black on lighter backgrounds.

3Logo Lockup

We use the logo pairing lockups to clearly show an account in on
X. When pairing a username with the X logo, make sure the logo is
white or black, and we recommend pairing it with the username in
black. Observe our clear space rules, and scale the text to 100%
of the height of the logo. Feel free to use a typeface thatâs from
your brandâs design system.

Aligning partnership logos should also follow clear space rules.

4Primary Colors

Our primary colors are black and white. Black plays a very
important role in all brand assets and should provide balance with
white. Together, they ensure neutrality, communicate powerfully
and provide consistency across brand communications.

Note: We are currently developing the secondary colors and will include
them in an updated version of the brand guidelines.

We partnered with media agency 1 and media
agency 2 to understand what factors inï¬uence a
consumerâs purchase decision. Â¼ of a consumerâs
purchase decision is driven by how culturally relevant
the brand is -- that is not insigniï¬cant.

**Can also use X Spaces / X Ads depending on the contextPosts

We use posts to highlight conversations and tell stories. They
should always retain their basic structure.

We increase the size of the post content to better ï¬t formats, to
amplify the post and its message, and to make sure the post can
work as a tagline or statement.

Dark mode posts are preferred. White can be used as an alternative
to dark mode when the color scheme or context feels appropriate.

Include our logo in the top right so that when used, our brand is
recognized.

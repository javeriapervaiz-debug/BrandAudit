BRAND GUIDELINES 2024

Switcher Brand Guidelines 1brand guidelines

These guidelines were developed to define and inform Switcherâs
brand â how we look, sound, and feel to our audience. This
document outlines usage for our logos, typefaces, color palettes,
icons, patterns, and so on. It also includes key positioning that
informs how we communicate with our audience.

Why are brand guidelines necessary?
From our proprietary logos to the words we choose, each of these guidelines comprises one piece of our full brand
identity. Adhering to guidelines helps preserve our visual identity, build recognition, protect our logo assets, and craft
powerful and resonant messaging across channels.

Switcher Brand Guidelines 5brand voice
Switcher's voice is direct, confident, encouraging, and upbeat.

Our voice can be heard in everything we create (even when words arenât involved).
It informs who we are and how we present ourselves to the world.
Direct We exist in a competitive landscape. We donât want to waste anyoneâs time or energy, so we
streamline messaging and remove complexity. No BS, no fluff, no jargon: We create simple
and accessible solutions, so we write simple and accessible content.
Confident We may be a startup, but weâre not just starting â we know our stuff. We believe
in our product and the limitless potential of our users, but we donât bluster: Our
messaging has a laid-back conviction.
Encouraging Weâre not just empowering our users by providing the tools they need to
succeed â weâre also their biggest cheerleaders. We invite our audience
to dream big with us, because we win when our customers win.

Upbeat Weâre innovative, nimble, and forward-thinking. We refuse to stagnate â weâre continually
growing and evolving alongside our users. We stay energetic, enthusiastic, and a little bit
playful (because video should be fun, even when itâs your business).

These are the go-to logos for all brand communications. It's a trademark to help viewers easily identify the Switcher
brand. It is essential that the logo is always applied with care and respect.

Alternative Lockups
The Switcher brand also has a typographic-only mark (1) and an icon mark (2). These are to be used particularly in
situations where legibility at small screen sizes becomes an issue. The Switcher information lockup (3) should be
standard when information needs to be listed on any type of form, email, or printed piece.

When using the Switcher logo on dark backgrounds, simply inverse the logo to a complete white. When color cannot
be used, simplify the mark by using all black.

Switcher Brand Guidelines 11clear space

To ensure the prominence and legibility of the logo, always surround it with a field of clear space. Clear space isolates
the logo from competing graphic elements such as text or photography that may divert attention from the logo. This
area is measured using the height of the capital S in the logo, as shown. No other graphic elements, typography, rules,
or images should appear inside this clear space.

Minimum Size

Minimum size refers to the smallest dimensions allowed for the Switcher logo. The minimum sizes for each
configuration of the logo are listed below.

For print: 0.75" minimum
For web: 60 pixel minimum
For print: 1" minimum
For web: 100 pixel minimum
For print: 0.25" minimum
For web: 30 pixel minimum

Switcher Brand Guidelines 12correct logo usage

The logo can be placed on a background with one of the colors from the primary or secondary color palette, as well as
white, black, or gray. Here are examples of the logo applied in these instances.

The logo can also be placed on images, but there must be enough contrast between the image and logo for
acceptable readability. In most instances, the logotype should be used in white when placed on imagery except
when the background is bright enough for the type to be rendered in color.

Switcher Brand Guidelines 13incorrect logo usage

The Switcher logo should not be adjusted or edited in any way. Here are some examples of what not to do:
1. Don't change the colors of the logo. 6. Don't place the logo on top of an image with poor

Switcher Brand Guidelines 14icon systemiconography

Our icons were originally created to represent menu items within the Switcher Studio app, and for use on
switcherstudio.com. These icons may never substitute the main logo, but may be used across the entire brand.
Incorporating icons into layouts is a great way to break up large portions of text and images. They also make
content more visual and easily digestible. Switcher icons are made with light line strokes and can be created in
any brand color other than black.

Create an icon in a 40 x 40 bounding box with a 2-pt stroke weight. Some icons may be taller or wider, but the
scale should feel comparable. Once made, the strokes should be outlined before scaling up or down in size.

Note: Do not edit any individual element of the icons.
